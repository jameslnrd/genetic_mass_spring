# Genetic strings
> Simulating instruments using genetic algorithms

## Description
This project allows the _evolution_ of a string-shaped model based on its spectral similarities (spectrogram, MFCC) with a target

## TODO
- implement cost function
- implement genetic algorithm
- wrap into simulation
